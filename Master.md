# Systems of Linear Equations
https://sbarone7.math.gatech.edu/Chapters_1_and_2.pdf
## Linear Equation
$a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_n x_n = b$
a's are **coefficients**, x's are **variables**, n is the **dimension** (number of variables)
e.g. $2x_1 + 4x_2 = 4$ has two dimensions

## Row Reduction
#### Row Operations
1. Replacement/Addition
2. Interchange
3. Scaling
Row operations can be used to solve systems of linear equations
